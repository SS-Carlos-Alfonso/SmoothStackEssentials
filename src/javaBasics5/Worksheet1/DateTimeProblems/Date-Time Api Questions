 Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?

	I would choose to use the LocalDateTime class. Using the LocalDate time we can store our birthdate as year-month-day-hour-minute-second. In order to change
	the date we can use the Period class to transfer the data into years months and days.

 Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?
 
 	You would use the previous method of the TemporalAdjuster class. date.with(TemporalAdjuster.previous(DayOfWeek.THURSDAY)); 
 

 What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
 
 	Both of them track an offset from UTC time but the difference is that the ZoneOffset class only
 	tracks from the absolute offset from UTC.
 

 How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?
    
    ZonedDateTime zonedateTime = ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.now(), ZoneId.systemDefault());
